    <h1>Controls Assessment Checklist</h1>
    <p>This project involved assessing the organization's security controls and compliance with industry standards, including PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC Type 2. Through a structured checklist, gaps were identified in areas like least privilege, encryption, disaster recovery, and password policies. Actionable recommendations were provided to mitigate risks, improve data protection, and enhance the organization’s alignment with regulatory requirements. The project underscores the importance of continuous auditing and implementing best practices to maintain a robust security posture.</p>
