    <h2>Incident Handler's Journal Entry</h2>
    <p><strong>Date:</strong> July 23, 2024</p>
    <p><strong>Entry:</strong> #1</p>
    
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Documenting a cybersecurity incident.</p>
    
    <h3>Tool(s) Used</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Wireshark:</strong> For network monitoring</li>
        <li><strong>SIEM Platform:</strong> For incident logging and alerts</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>The 5 W's</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Who:</strong> An external group of hackers exploiting weak access control policies and phishing tactics.</li>
        <li><strong>What:</strong> A potential data breach from unauthorized access to critical systems via phishing and credential theft.</li>
        <li><strong>Where:</strong> At Source Technology</li>
        <li><strong>When:</strong> July 23, 2024, at 9:00 a.m.</li>
        <li><strong>Why:</strong> The attackers exploited a phishing vulnerability where an employee unknowingly clicked on a malicious link, allowing the attackers to steal credentials and access internal systems. The breach was likely aimed at either data theft or deploying further exploits to access sensitive business data.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Additional Notes</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Implementing a more robust email filtering system to catch phishing attempts before reaching employees.</li>
        <li>Enhancing user access controls to ensure critical data is better protected by limiting unnecessary access.</li>
        <li>Conducting frequent phishing simulations and training to ensure employees recognize phishing tactics.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h3>Incident Response Steps Taken</h3>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Identification:</strong> An employee reported unusual system behavior, including strange email alerts and unauthorized file access attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Containment:</strong> Immediately blocked the phishing email source and isolated affected systems to prevent lateral movement.</li>
        <li><strong>Eradication:</strong> Conducted a thorough investigation of logs and systems, confirmed that the breach was due to credential theft from phishing, and removed all unauthorized access points.</li>
        <li><strong>Recovery:</strong> Restored systems from backups, ensuring no ransomware or malware was present in the recovered data.</li>
        <li><strong>Lessons Learned:</strong>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Reinforced phishing a
