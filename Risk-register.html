    <h2>Notes</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Financial Records Leak:</strong> Given the severity of a public exposure of financial data, this risk is prioritized higher. The bank faces potential regulatory fines and loss of customer trust if this occurs. The mitigation strategy focuses on securing database servers, encrypting backup data, and performing regular security assessments.</li>
        <li><strong>Business Email Compromise:</strong> This is a moderate risk due to the commonality of phishing attacks. With proper employee training, phishing simulation campaigns, and strong email security measures, the likelihood of this risk can be mitigated effectively.</li>
        <li><strong>Theft:</strong> Despite being a lower likelihood risk due to the area’s low crime rate, this risk still has a high severity if it were to occur. The bank has a plan to address it with physical security measures and controls.</li>
        <li><strong>Supply Chain Disruption:</strong> This is a moderate risk for the bank, and although it is less likely, disruptions can still impact operations. Mitigation strategies include preparing for emergencies with backup suppliers and maintaining sufficient stock of essential materials.</li>
