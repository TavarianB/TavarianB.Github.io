    <h1>Vulnerability Assessment Report</h1>
    <p>A detailed report assessing the organization's database server for vulnerabilities, risks, and mitigation strategies.</p>
    
    <h2>System Description</h2>
    <p>The organization’s database server operates on robust hardware featuring a powerful CPU and 128GB of memory. It runs the latest version of the Linux operating system and utilizes MySQL as its database management system. The server is configured with a stable IPv4 network connection, interacting seamlessly with other servers in the network. Current security measures include SSL/TLS-encrypted connections to safeguard data during transmission. This server is a critical component of the organization, supporting essential marketing operations by storing customer, campaign, and analytic data for performance tracking and personalization.</p>
    
    <h2>Scope</h2>
    <p>This vulnerability assessment focuses on the access control mechanisms of the database server. The evaluation covers a three-month period, from June 2025 to August 2025, to ensure a thorough review of the system’s security posture. NIST SP 800-30 Rev. 1 guidelines have been adopted to conduct the risk analysis, emphasizing the identification of vulnerabilities and potential threats to the information system.</p>
    
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The primary purpose of this assessment is to secure the database server from unauthorized access and potential data breaches. Given the server’s central role in storing sensitive customer and campaign data, any compromise could have significant repercussions for the organization. By identifying and mitigating risks, the organization aims to enhance system security, protect operational integrity, and maintain compliance with industry regulations.</p>
    
    <h2>Risk Assessment</h2>

                <td>3</td>
                <td>6</td>
                <td>No role-based access control</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Customer</td>
                <td>Alter/Delete critical information</td>
                <td>1</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>3</td>
                <td>Limited public access</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
    
    <h2>Approach</h2>
    <p>The methodology for this assessment considered the data storage and management procedures of the business. Threat sources and potential threat events were analyzed based on the likelihood of exploitation and their potential impact on operational processes. Particular attention was given to open access permissions within the information system, which could increase the chances of unauthorized access. The severity of potential incidents was weighed against the organization’s need for operational efficiency to develop an effective and balanced risk mitigation plan.</p>
    
    <h2>Remediation Strategy</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Implement authentication, authorization, and auditing mechanisms to ensure that only authorized users can access the database server.</li>
        <li>Enforce strong passwords, role-based access controls, and multi-factor authentication to reduce the likelihood of unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Upgrade encryption protocols to TLS 1.3 for data in motion and apply AES-256 encryption to data at rest.</li>
        <li>Restrict database access to corporate offices using IP allow-listing, with remote employees required to use a secure VPN.</li>
        <li>Deploy a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system for continuous monitoring and real-time anomaly detection.</li>
        <li>Maintain a consistent patching schedule to address vulnerabilities in the Linux operating system and MySQL database.</li>
    </ul>
